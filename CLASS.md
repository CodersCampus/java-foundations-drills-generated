# Projects for Instantiating a Class, a Method, and Calling the Method

WTH? Why do I even care about classes, methods, and how to create and consume them?

These are actually vital questions to ask yourself. You should eventually know why you are constantly reorganizing your code, and even reorganizing code that other people wrote, and that you are just maintaining.

These drills don't try to explain why, but assume you have some idea why you might want to re-organize some code into new classes, new methods.

## Pre Reqs:
- You have already done [these drills](PROJECT.md) and so you can create a project easily without thinking about it.
- You have accepted the idea that you might need to reorganize code sometimes, even if you aren't always sure when and why.

## Moving a block of code to another class and/or method.

These instructions assume you want to practice moving something in one block of code into another block of code in another class, just for that purpose.

## How many of these should I do?

These are auto-generated, so we generated more than you would need. Just keep doing it until your muscle memory is formed.
If you are not sure, come back later and do some more, to see if your muscle memory is holding solid.

Until then, you know what to do.

## Always Delete These Practice Projects!

Don't worry, you won't miss them. Keeping your workspace clean and uncluttered will help you maintain self confidence.

You got this. It's all in your muscle memory.

 - Then - in the body of that class named `Doctor` create a `attitude` method that returns void and takes a String for an arg, and name that incoming argument `reputation`. It must have public access modifier.
 - In the body of that method named `attitude`, write `System.out.println("Hello again there " + reputation);`
 - Next - in the body of the main method above, declare a variable for, and then instantiate a new `Doctor` class assigned to that variable, and use the variable representing that class to call the `attitude` method that you just wrote, passing in "pattern" as the argument.
 - Then run the program and confirm that it writes `Hello again there pattern` into the console
 (So far the fastest timed execution of this sequence is 3 minutes, 17 seconds.)


## Make new project named `DegreeProject`
 - Then make a new package `com.coderscampus.degree.main`
 - Then - in that package, create a class named `DegreeApp`, with a static main method
 - Then - in the body of the main method in the class named `DegreeApp` write `System.out.println("Hello end");`
 - Then run the program and confirm that it writes `Hello end` into the console

#### Now, the second class ...
 - These instructions get a little bit word-salad-ish, but you have to learn these terms anyway ... so here goes.
 - Make a new package `com.coderscampus.degree.util`
 - Then - in that package, create a class named `Claim`, with a an empty body - no methods
 - Then - in the body of that class named `Claim` create a `dream` method that returns void and takes a String for an arg, and name that incoming argument `library`. It must have public access modifier.
 - In the body of that method named `dream`, write `System.out.println("Hello again there " + library);`
 - Next - in the body of the main method above, declare a variable for, and then instantiate a new `Claim` class assigned to that variable, and use the variable representing that class to call the `dream` method that you just wrote, passing in "blame" as the argument.
 - Then run the program and confirm that it writes `Hello again there blame` into the console
 (So far the fastest timed execution of this sequence is 3 minutes, 17 seconds.)


## Make new project named `SpiritProject`
 - Then make a new package `com.coderscampus.spirit.main`
 - Then - in that package, create a class named `SpiritApp`, with a static main method
 - Then - in the body of the main method in the class named `SpiritApp` write `System.out.println("Hello field");`
 - Then run the program and confirm that it writes `Hello field` into the console

#### Now, the second class ...
 - These instructions get a little bit word-salad-ish, but you have to learn these terms anyway ... so here goes.
 - Make a new package `com.coderscampus.spirit.util`
 - Then - in that package, create a class named `Idea`, with a an empty body - no methods
 - Then - in the body of that class named `Idea` create a `individual` method that returns void and takes a String for an arg, and name that incoming argument `leg`. It must have public access modifier.
 - In the body of that method named `individual`, write `System.out.println("Hello again there " + leg);`
 - Next - in the body of the main method above, declare a variable for, and then instantiate a new `Idea` class assigned to that variable, and use the variable representing that class to call the `individual` method that you just wrote, passing in "method" as the argument.
 - Then run the program and confirm that it writes `Hello again there method` into the console
 (So far the fastest timed execution of this sequence is 3 minutes, 17 seconds.)


## Make new project named `MortgageProject`
 - Then make a new package `com.coderscampus.mortgage.main`
 - Then - in that package, create a class named `MortgageApp`, with a static main method
 - Then - in the body of the main method in the class named `MortgageApp` write `System.out.println("Hello confusion");`
 - Then run the program and confirm that it writes `Hello confusion` into the console

#### Now, the second class ...
 - These instructions get a little bit word-salad-ish, but you have to learn these terms anyway ... so here goes.
 - Make a new package `com.coderscampus.mortgage.util`
 - Then - in that package, create a class named `Guarantee`, with a an empty body - no methods
 - Then - in the body of that class named `Guarantee` create a `due` method that returns void and takes a String for an arg, and name that incoming argument `estimate`. It must have public access modifier.
 - In the body of that method named `due`, write `System.out.println("Hello again there " + estimate);`
 - Next - in the body of the main method above, declare a variable for, and then instantiate a new `Guarantee` class assigned to that variable, and use the variable representing that class to call the `due` method that you just wrote, passing in "pin" as the argument.
 - Then run the program and confirm that it writes `Hello again there pin` into the console
 (So far the fastest timed execution of this sequence is 3 minutes, 17 seconds.)
