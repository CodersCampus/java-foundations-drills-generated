#[[#]]# Projects + Main Methods + Static Method Exit

Learning java foundations requires it's own setup, which is different from the full stack world in some respects.

In the full stack world, some things are already set up for you by the project lead, and you "join" that project. Not so, when you are providing everything all in one stack.

#[[###]]# Here is what you have to create, to set up each java-code-learning exercise or assignment:

- You have to set up your own projects to learn with.
- You have to learn enough about `public static void main` to use it fresh every new exercise or assignment.

Since the above aspects can be confusing and awkward, we provide these drills. That way, if any confusion happens, you can resolve that confusion before taking it into the actual exercise or assignment.

#[[##]]# How many of these should I do?

These are auto-generated, so we generated more than you would need. Just keep doing it until your muscle memory is formed.
If you are not sure, come back later and do some more, to see if your muscle memory is holding solid.

Until then, you know what to do.

#[[##]]# Always Delete These Practice Projects!

Don't worry, you won't miss them. Keeping your workspace clean and uncluttered will help you maintain self confidence.

You got this. It's all in your muscle memory.
